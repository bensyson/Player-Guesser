## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of sophistication and focus, fitting for a quiz app.
- Background color: Light Indigo (#E6E6FA) offering a subtle, desaturated backdrop that doesn't distract from the main content.
- Accent color: Vivid Violet (#8F00FF) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions, providing a striking contrast.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif font for titles; Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanistic sans-serif for the game's textual content. The fonts complement each other in legibility and feel.
- Use clear, minimalist icons for settings and actions. Consistent style across all icons.
- Maintain a clean, single-view layout. Use stacked 'club bubbles' as a central design element. Popover settings menu keeps the main screen uncluttered.
- Subtle transitions for revealing the player and loading new player data. Smooth animations for toggling dark mode and opening the settings menu.
